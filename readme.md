# Macros... because clicking several buttons is hard and we like to min-max.
### Make sure you have [CleveRoidMacros](https://github.com/bhhandley/CleveRoidMacros)(Custom functions) and [SuperMacro](https://github.com/Monteo/SuperMacro)(Size extender) installed as they are needed to work.
#### This are the macros I am currently using, feel free to change them as you like as this should be used as a start up to make your ones. If you have any questions, message me on discord @unlifed.
